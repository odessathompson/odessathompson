          Iâ€™m part of a wonderful team of talented software and hardware 
          engineers and together we collaborate to design and build an 
          autonomous aircraft for the international AUVSI SUAS Competition. I 
          focus on updating and redesigning the website,
           cuair.org, as well as filming, editing, and 
           directing the annual Flight Readiness Review which you can watch here.

          <!-- <a href="https://museum.cornell.edu/">Johnson</a> -->
        <p class="blurb-body"> Now on my second year at the Johnson, I've 
          created almost a dozen educational art videos to be used in elementary
           STEM curriculum. These link New York educational core learning 
           targets with fun and creative art concepts to help bridge the gap 
           between the Johnson and local schools.<br> More recently I wrote and 
           illustrated a children's book about shapes for a collaboration 
           between the Johnson Museum, the Ithaca School District, and Kids 
           Discover the Trail!

        <h3> Explore Intern, 2021</h4>
        <p class="blurb-body"> In the summer after my freshman year, I was an 
          Explore Intern at Microsoft! The Explore program is a freshman & sophomore
          focused internship where interns (as the name suggests) explore both 
          Software Engineering and Project Management roles for 12 weeks. I worked 
          in the Web Experiences - Shopping team, where my fellow interns and I 
          developed an Android app for in-store price comparision. While this 
          internship was remote due to the pandemic, I really enjoyed working 
          with my team and meeting other Computer Science students from around 
          the country. I'm returning as a SWE intern in 2023 and I'm very 
          excited to see and learn more!</p>
